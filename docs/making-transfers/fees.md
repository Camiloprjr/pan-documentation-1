MATIC has a fee for each transaction, but at PAN-X you can choose how much you want to pay for it depending on how soon you want to receive your purchase. This has to do with how much gas is used to fulfill that transaction: the faster, the more expensive and the more energy-demanding. 

Then you might ask, why would you be in a hurry to get your item? Consider a scenario in which a game company releases a rare item, with a very small quantity. In cases like this, it is important that your purchase is done quickly, so you will have the chance to acquire one of the few offers before it is sold out.
