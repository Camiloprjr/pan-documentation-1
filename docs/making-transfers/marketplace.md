PAN-Xâ€™s marketplace is a centralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network that connects NFT owners, sellers, and consumers in a transparent and direct way, without the need for intermediaries. 

All NFTs Buy and Sell Orders are listed on the PAN-X marketplace. Users can create their own orders and trades by stipulating which NFT they want in exchange, how much in PAN tokens they want for payment or use both methods in the negotiation. Applicable fees can be chosen according to the demands and preferences of the users.

You can only purchase in-game items in case you have enough balance in your account. This includes both the price of the item and the applicable fees. Currently, the purchase can only be made on the PAN-X platform, but affiliated game companies are encouraged to include this feature in-game.
