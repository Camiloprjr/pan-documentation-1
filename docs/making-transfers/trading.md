PAN-X was designed to work not simply as a marketplace, but as a social platform where you can interact with friends and game companies. With the built-in chat, you can negotiate transactions of in-game content and collectibles acquired via PAN-X without the need to share your personal contact information with other users. 

The safety of  transactions is granted by PANâ€™s system which works with the Polygon platform and the MATIC token, a mechanism of proof-of-stake consensus which operates the transactions. That technology will make sure that the purchased or traded item will be transferred from an account to the other, and that the wallets are updated.
