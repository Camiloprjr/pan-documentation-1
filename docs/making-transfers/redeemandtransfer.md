You can redeem your PAN tokens by exchanging them for your preferred fiat currency. For that, you must fill a form informing:

- The amount of PAN tokens that you want to redeem from your wallet. You can also choose the applicable MATIC and PAN fees for the transaction.
- The KYC (Know Your Customer) process is only mandatory for transactions over USD$ 10,000 or when you overcome this limit in withdrawals during the period of 30 days. KYC fees are applicable in addition to transaction fees. 

We use the KYC process to generate more in-depth knowledge of the users and ensure businesses that the transactions are being safely performed. By analyzing customer data, we are able to reduce risks for both users and businesses affiliated with the platform. By granting this solid and secure relationship with game companies and players, we incentivize the industry to create products and services that adhere to the market.
