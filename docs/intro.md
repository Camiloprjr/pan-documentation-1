>  Official PAN-X Whitepaper

## PAN-X

PAN-X is a platform designed to simplify exchanges between game companies and consumers who are interested in purchasing in-game content and collectibles. Skins, new characters, weapons, and collectible art minted in NFT (non-fungible tokens) are first sold by the game company, then traded by players via the platform. 

PAN-X works in a similar way to collector albums. In the early 2000s stickers, cards, and “tazos” could be purchased in a random bundle at stores, or you could play with friends and compete for new items, trade them, and eventually sell or buy directly from someone. 
With PAN-X, we are reducing the distance between the game company and players by allowing transactions to happen in a safe, transparent, and uncomplicated platform based on blockchain. By using a digital wallet and acquiring items minted in NFT, you are protected by advanced cryptography and assured of the authenticity of your purchased item.
As more game companies populate the metaverse, PAN works as a bridge connecting the game industry with blockchain-based solutions. We aim to provide resources for the development of a community-governed collection platform and allow game studios to work based on DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) frameworks by using our technology.

## Mission

We want to help game companies join the blockchain industry and offer new opportunities for players to buy content and collectibles, as well as turn these items into assets. By closely following the NFT market, we understood that the game industry could as well take the opportunity to expand its products and services.
But in spite of blockchain technology being developed to make things simpler, there are still a lot of specifics when it comes to regulamentation, operations, and the use of the technology itself. PAN wants to facilitate the exchanges between game companies and players while using a seamless blockchain-based ecosystem that offers advantageable opportunities for all sides.
Working as an initiator of metaverses, the PAN-X platform “bypasses” cutting edge technology to make it simpler to understand and use, thus allowing deeper and broader innovation in the sector. We believe our technology is fundamental for game companies which are aiming to build and merge their own metaverses, thus entering this new era of the internet.

## Value proposition

Collectible items have been around for quite a while. In fact, historians suppose that collecting things is as primeval as the origin of our species. Video games have just taken the opportunity to expand this experience to digital platforms. While collectibles do not necessarily have a monetary value, it is still possible to trade them with other users or even earn in-store credits for future purchases.

With the advent of the NFT, collectibles and trades can be better documented and secured as the technology offers unique and incorruptible digital identifiers which assure the origin, specifications, and ownership of items. Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for players to collect and trade items from their favorite games, ultimately turning these exchanges into an opportunity for investment. While all exchanges are made with the PAN TOKEN in the platform, credits can be withdrawn to the preferred currency.

## Ecosystem Governance

The PAN ecosystem works as a provider of the technology that enables transparent, and direct peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges between NFT owners (game companies), sellers, and consumers. We are responsible for the management of all exchanges performed on the platform, hence ensuring the operability, availability, security, and transparency of processes. 

PAN adopts the approach of private blockchain platforms in order to provide support and to upgrade applications, functionalities, and the ecosystem’s marketplace. We grant that the platform is always available and transactions are safely protected from attacks and breaches when performed through our technology and services.

## Vision

PAN is a new actor joining the global movement of transition from the traditional financial market to the crypto market and the advent of stablecoins with regulated funds. Backed by the stablecoin issued by Colb In (StableColb), PAN offers a platform through which game companies can seamlessly mint digital assets on the blockchain and sell NFT assets to users.

Our mission is to offer an NFT marketplace through which game companies and users can sell and trade digital assets and thus generate value through a centralized, KYC-compliant platform. Compared to other blockchain-based initiatives which are decentralized, PAN offers centralization as a guarantee of security, availability of services, and compliance with regulations. 

By facilitating the inclusion of game companies in the NFT and crypto markets, we are disrupting the way industries can take advantage of these technologies to do business. We want to show that blockchain and crypto are much more than Bitcoin. It is rather a means to leverage x` and provide more comprehensive systems to businesses.

PAN is committed to help businesses understand the value of joining the blockchain market by making this process easier and comprehensive. After all, we believe that adopting this mediator role can help us move towards a future of innovation and disruption for the creative industries. 

As a future-oriented project, PAN is committed to take action against climate change and negative environmental impact. This is why our platform PAN-X uses Polygon to make transactions. 

Polygon uses a modified proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain mechanism which grants the safety, speed, as well as the low costs of exchanges based on its MATIC token. While some of the biggest PoW blockchains can consume a yearly quota of anywhere between 35-140 TWh of electricity in average, Polygon is a sustainable alternative whose validators approximately consume 0.00079TWh of electricity each year, with an approximate continuous draw of 0.00009GW.

To put Polygon’s carbon footprint in perspective, here are some equivalents made available by the platform for how much emission the blockchain creates yearly:
