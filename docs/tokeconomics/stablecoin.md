PAN-X works with a token that is backed by the stablecoin emitted by the Colb In  project. The StableColb USD (SCB) is a claimable stablecoin strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar that is collateralized, issued in accordance with Swiss regulations, and transparently verified by third-party attestations. 

All SCB in circulation is worth USD 1 and is redeemable with cash, which is deposited in a Swiss private Bank. Designed as a road between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, SCB combines price stability on the U.S. Dollar with the technology and efficiency advantages of a digital asset. As an ERC-20 token, SCB can be used on the Ethereum network or any Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchain.

By its turn, a stablecoin is a class of cryptocurrency which aims to provide price stability and is backed by a reserve asset. For the past years, stablecoins have gained traction precisely because they create a bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Stablecoins enable the transition to an economy based on the instant processing and security of payments performed with cryptocurrency, but without the usual volatility that characterizes it.

While the PAN-X platform gives full control over the operations to the game company, the PAN token is decentralized as it is a functionality based on the blockchain. When a PAN token is purchased, even if the PAN-X platform shuts down, the user will still own that balance.
