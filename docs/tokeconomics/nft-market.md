Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are unique digital assets that can be photos, GIFs, audio, video, or any other digital item which can be secured on the blockchain and bought and sold through marketplace platforms such as OpenSea. 

In 2021, the total value of all NFT transactions worldwide increased 21,350%, totalling more than USD 17 billion from USD 82.5 million registered in 2020 according to the NonFungible.com report. 

As of 2022, 28% of the NFT market size is in U.S. dollars and 48% in ETH, numbers that show that NFTs have outperformed crypto, which had a decrease of 15-20% during the same year.

Collectible assets and gaming items were two of the leading categories in the surge of NFT transactions in 2021. According to Fortune, it is estimated that the collectibles category alone has generated more than USD 8.4 billion in sales during that period.

PAN joins this market by offering a centralized platform where game companies can sell digital assets minted in NFT to users who can then trade and sell these collectibles using the same platform. 

Based on the MATIC token and the Polygon blockchain, PAN-X is a platform that also offers the possibility of redeeming tokens in fiat currency, thus offering the possibility for users to make it a new source of income.
