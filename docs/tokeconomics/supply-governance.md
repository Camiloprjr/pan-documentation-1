In order to commercialize their items on the PAN-X platform, game companies must develop an NFT collection before submitting it. The NFT collection can include images, in-game items or skins. 

The game company must first submit the collection via the PAN-X marketplace and fill a formulaire including the name of the collection and further information about the NFTs. Affiliated game companies can register as many NFTs as desired on the same request. 

The request will be sent to the backoffice, where PAN-X employees will analyze it before featuring the content on the marketplace. The analysis will be performed according to the parameters and conditions already pre-defined in a commercial contract signed by both parties(game company and PAN). 

After the request is approved, the collection will be featured on the PAN-X marketplace. In case the collection is not approved, the company will be notified. Fees might be applicable in this process.

We offer different possibilities of NFTs to be featured on our marketplace, for instance:

- NFT Art: An art piece that does not interfere with the game and/or is not featured in-game.
- NFT Skin: In-game cosmetic items which do not influence in-game balance or offer extra functionalities. 
- NFT in Game Utility: Content that influences in-game mechanics by giving advantages to the owner and influencing competitively in the game.
